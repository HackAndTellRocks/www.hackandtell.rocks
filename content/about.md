# WHAT IS A HACK AND TELL?
8 hours of creative and collaborative production. No business models. No
customer validation. No pitches. **Just a time to hang out and create something
awesome.** Oh, plus delicious food.

# WHAT WILL YOU MAKE?
Build something for yourself, your friends, or help someone else build
something. It can be useful or completely useless. In short, **build whatever
you want**. At the end of the event, you'll get the chance to stand up and show
us what you built or not. Still not sure? Check out the
[past events]({{< ref "/events" >}}) to see what others have done.
