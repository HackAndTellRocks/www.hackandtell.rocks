# About

Hack and Tell is 8 hours of creative and collaborative production. No business
models. No customer validation. No pitches. **Just a time to hang out and
create something awesome.**

Build something for yourself, your friends, or help someone else build
something. It can be useful or completely useless. In short, **build whatever
you want**. At the end of the event, you'll get the chance to stand up and show
us what you built or not. And if you do present you can pick a fun prize as
well!
