We are pleased to announce that the 26th Hack and Tell will be December 21st
2024!

Thank you everyone for your support as we are getting these events going
again! However we do not currently have a lunch sponsor for this event so we
are ***NOT*** going to be able to provide lunch. I know this is a bummer, but
this event is in the 3rd Ward so there are lots of lunch options available.

Also, we ask that everyone please make sure you RSVP if you are planning on
coming. Like wise, if you've RSVP'd and aren't going to make it please make
sure to cancel your RSVP as we generally have limited space and would hate to
turn anyone away.

# About

Hack and Tell is 8 hours of creative and collaborative production. No business
models. No customer validation. No pitches. **Just a time to hang out and
create something awesome.**

Build something for yourself, your friends, or help someone else build
something. It can be useful or completely useless. In short, **build whatever
you want**. At the end of the event, you'll get the chance to stand up and show
us what you built or not. And if you do present you can pick a fun prize as
well!

# RSVP

RSVP's are [Open](https://www.meetup.com/hackandtell/events/304722314) on our
new [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/hackandtell/)!
