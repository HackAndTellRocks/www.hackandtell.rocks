# Frequently Asked Quests (FAQ)

Here is a list of questions we get asked frequently? If your question isn't
answered here, please reach out and if it's asked frequently enough it'll get
added here!

## WHO CAN COME?

Anyone. Anyone who codes, designs, or wants to work on something cool. If you
don't already know how to do these things, you can spend the time learning how,
and show everyone what you learned. That's great too!

## CODE OF CONDUCT

Hack and Tell Milwaukee is dedicated to providing a harrasment-free event
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue. Event
participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event
at the discretion of the event organizers.
[Read the extended Code of Conduct]({{< ref "/codeofconduct" >}}).

## CAN I COME WITHOUT AN IDEA?

Absolutely! You can join someone else's project, work on a challenge project
provided by one of the RokkinCats, or dream up something on the spot. You can
fiddle with anything you've been tinkering with: prototype that business idea,
prove to a co-worker that your algorithm will work in that one special case, or
make a gift for a special someone.

## WHAT SHOULD I BRING?

Most people bring their laptops, chargers, and anything else they need to work
on their projects. Feel free to bring anything you need: a loom, a guitar, etc.
Tell us in advance if you plan to bring something that could be considered a
weapon, but anything else is fair game.

## IS THIS ONE OF THOSE IDEA GRABS? WHO OWNS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF WHAT GETS PRESENTED?

We don't want to own the rights to your ideas. You retain 100% of the ownership
of your ideas. We are just here to help them move it forward.

## WILL THERE BE FOOD?

Yes, we will provide breakfast and lunch. Breakfast is typically pastries,
bagels, donuts, and coffee from local restaurant. Lunch is typically an
assortment of different burritos from Chipotle, all with white rice. If you
can't eat what we're planning to bring, please let us know and we'll order you
something else.

## WILL THERE BE PRIZES?

An assortment of small prizes will be awarded at each event. These are usually
board games, microodrones, nerf guns, or small gadgets. If you or your company
would like to donate some prizes, we'd love to have them! Please contact us!

## WHY DO YOU RUN YOUR HACKATHON DIFFERENTLY THAN EVERYONE ELSE?

We believe a business plan shouldn't win a hackathon. We keep our prize values
low, and we welcome only people who want to build stuff. If you're interested
in why, read this article we wrote about the
[Three Types of Harmful Hackathons](https://web.archive.org/web/20221127144446mp_/https://rokkincat.com/blog/2015-04-13-three-types-of-harmful-hackathons/).

## DO I HAVE TO TALK IN FRONT OF EVERYONE?

Nope, no pressure at all. We always love to see what cool stuff people are
making, but we understand public presentations aren't for everyone. If you do
present, we ask that you keep it short and sweet. A good general format is:

> I made ________, and it does ________. I worked on it because  ________ and
> it is made with ________. Before today, I had done ________, and today I
> worked on ________.
